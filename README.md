# Fake vs Real Photo Classification Using CNN Algorithms

Together with my teammate [Emirhan VARLIK](https://github.com/EmirhanVarlk), we conducted a machine learning project to distinguish between fake and real photos. In this project, we used SqueezeNet and ShuffleNet models to classify fake and real photos. 🤖📷

## Project Steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: We updated the paths and labels of the image files. 🛠️
2. **Data Transformations**: We applied various transformations to the images (rotation, cropping, color adjustments). 🎨
3. **Model Creation**: We used SqueezeNet and ShuffleNet models and added new classifiers. 🧠
4. **Model Training**: We trained the models on training and validation datasets and evaluated their performance. 📈

## Results:
**Accuracy**: 96% 🎯

### Classification Report:
- **Precision**: 97% ✔️
- **Recall**: 96% (Real), 98% (Fake) 📊
- **F1-Score**: 96% (Real), 97% (Fake) 🏅
